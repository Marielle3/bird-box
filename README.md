# Project_2 

## Coffee Ride App! 

The goal of this app is to target Bike Riders in Downtown Portland, Oregon that love to bike, drink coffee, and meet new friends! 

**Instructions** 
 1. Install express, express-handlebars, pusher, mysql, and path. 
 2. On command line, run node server.js and this will direct you to open up localhost:3000/registration 
  * This will ask you for Name, Email, and Password
 3. After registration it will redirect to login page, where you input Username and Password that you just created 
 4. After clicking login, this will then redirect you to the Coffee Ride Live Chat room where you can create conversation and start a bike route around Downtown Portland and grab a cup of joe.

**What we are missing/ Add Ons**
- As our pages are ready to connect with one another, the missing piece is having a map route out where the bikers want to go and if they are currently in progress with a group. 

- Create teams and create a competition of fastest route completion

- Mark favorite coffee shops or recommendations of links off to the side in chat room

- Grab discount codes to local coffee shops to help promote business 

- Profile pictures for users 

**New Library**
* Pusher 
  - Pusher Channels provides realtime communication between servers, apps and devices. Channels is used for notifications, chat, gaming, web-page updates, IoT, and many other systems requiring realtime communication.
